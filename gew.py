pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "truffle/Assert.sol";
import "truffle/DeployedAddresses.sol";
import "../contracts/SushiBar.sol";

contract TestSushiBar {
    SushiBar sushiBar;

    function beforeEach() public {
        sushiBar = new SushiBar();
    }

    function testServeSushi() public {
        // Call the serveSushi function on the sushiBar contract
        sushiBar.serveSushi();

        // Get the current sushiCount
        uint256 sushiCount = sushiBar.getSushiCount();

        // Assert that the sushiCount has increased by 1
        Assert.equal(sushiCount, 1, "Sushi serving failed");
    }
}
```

In this example, we assume that there is a `SushiBar` contract with a `serveSushi` function that increments a `sushiCount` variable by 1. The `beforeEach` function is used to deploy a new instance of the `SushiBar` contract before each test case is executed. The `testServeSushi` function calls the `serveSushi` function and then checks if the `sushiCount` has increased by 1 using the `Assert.equal` function.
